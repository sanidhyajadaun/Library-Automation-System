## 📋Getting Started
To get started with the Library Management System, you will need to install a C++ compiler. We recommend using GCC or Clang.

Once you have a C++ compiler set up, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/sanidhyajadaun/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
```

Next, you can compile the program by running the following command:

```
g++ -std=c++17 -o library library.cpp
```

Replace g++ with the path to your C++ compiler if necessary.

You can then run the program by executing the following command:

```
./library
```
